### This is the SQL Database:

### Available products in the database dispaying through the terminal:

### Typing in "8" selects the "8" product ID:

### This promts the user to select a quatity for purchase:

### Once the quantity has been entered, this prompt confirms that the amount is available in invenory and provides a total dollar amount:

### The user returns to the beginning and can select another product. In this case, the user wants to buy more than is available for purchase:

### The prompt says that the product is not available in the entered quantity and the user can try again:

## Work to Do
I was not able to get the SQL database to update with the new quantity. I'll be coming in for office hours. I think I got close, but wasn't able to get it to fully work.
